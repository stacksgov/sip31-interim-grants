_Please note that this interim grant program will operate with a strong preference toward known Stacks builders (and typically those with open-source projects) that have indicators of traction or demand. Not only is this is intended to be a recognition of the commitment of existing builders, it is a de-risked bet on known quantities with the assumption these grants are more likely to be impactful and can be reviewed much more quickly. If you are just starting out or at the idea stage, [please read this post](https://stx.is/sip-31-interim-grants) to review other paths that are available to you._ *Please confirm you have read this by removing it before submitting your application/issue.*
