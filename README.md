# üí° Open Ended Interim Grants from the Stacks Foundation
As the push to bring SIP-031 resources to the ecosystem carries on, this grant program is intended to bridge builders to new programs exected from the new Stacks Endowment later this year. You can also browse other opportunities [covered in this post](https://stx.is/sip-31-interim-grants) and identify the program that is most applicable to your project. 

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Details
Similar to our previous cohorts, we‚Äôll take applications of all varieties from builders in the community. We‚Äôll operate with a strong preference toward existing builders with open-source projects that have shown clear traction vs. brand new entrants or those at the idea stage. Not only is this is intended to be a recognition of their commitment, it is a de-risked bet on known quantities with the assumption these grants are more likely to be impactful. Additional programs [outlined here](https://stx.is/sip-31-interim-grants) can provide a path for those that are just starting out.

<ins>**Indicators of traction:**</ins>

Traction will be assessed by Stacks Foundation staff in partnership with community panelists, allowing for a contextual review (i.e. we won‚Äôt assess a developer tool with the same lens as a consumer app, and so forth).

- **Active users:** Indicates some kind of product market fit or general need is being served and that this app is beyond the idea stage because some kind of user interface has been built/shipped.
- **Transaction volume:** Indicates users are actively using the application or tool
- **TVL:** Indicates someone has invested capital into the system/application
- **Waitlist:** Could indicate future demand. This will be considered, but not weighted heavily as it is easy to game and there is often significant fall off between users that say they ‚Äòwill‚Äô use an app vs. those that actually do once it is available.

<ins>**Community Panelists:**</ins>
- Jackbinswitch, Community Leader
- Jonathan Sadlowe, Gossamer & Signal21
- Diego Mey, Bitflow & Marketing WG Lead

# üõ£Ô∏è Other Paths: 
### **üß° DeGrants:**
For builders that don't fit the open-ended program outlined here, we‚Äôve funded a third cohort of DeGrants that the community will dole out how it sees fit. Depending on the demand we see, we have some flexibility on the overall allocation here and will work with the leaders of the program to adjust it if there‚Äôs a good reason to. We highly recommend this path for brand new builders as it is a great opportunity to connect with the community, build credibility, and find funding for initial milestones/traction that can open the door to more grants or investment from the ecosystem down the line.

Applications **open on September 10th**, and will be **due October 8th** per the Stewards: https://degrants.xyz/cohort3.
